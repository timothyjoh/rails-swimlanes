## Review Complete

**Verdict: NEEDS-FIX**

### Code Quality — Key Findings

| Severity | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | `boards.name` column has no `null: false` DB constraint — model validation can be bypassed |
| Critical | `parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)` + SimpleCov are incompatible — coverage reporting is unreliable |
| Minor | `ApplicationController` missing explicit `before_action :require_authentication` (works implicitly via concern, but fragile) |
| Minor | `SessionsController` test uses `User.take` — non-deterministic fixture selection |
| Minor | `show` action/view added outside plan scope and untested |

### Test Quality — Key Findings

| Severity | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | SimpleCov parallelization issue means `minimum_coverage 80` is not reliably enforced |
| Minor | Sign-up failure test missing `assert_not User.exists?` negative assertion |
| Minor | Boards index test doesn't assert other users' boards are absent |
| Minor | E2E login test asserts heading text only, not URL |
| Minor | E2E delete dialog handler registered after visibility check (ordering risk in slow CI) |

**What's genuinely good:** No mock abuse anywhere, real ActiveRecord objects throughout, cross-user authorization tested for edit/update/delete (went beyond the plan), `uniqueEmail` helper in E2E avoids collision races, and the `SessionTestHelper` is a clean abstraction for test sign-in.
