STATUS.md updated. Here's a summary of what was written:

**Phase 4: Board Sharing** section added, covering:

- **What was built**: `BoardMembership` model with role enum, `Board.accessible_by` scope, authorization sweep across all 5 controller sites, `MembershipsController` with Turbo Stream add/remove, owner-only Members panel, view gates hiding Edit/Delete from collaborators, and non-member 404 on all board URLs.

- **Review findings**: 4 must-fixes resolved (transaction gap in board creation, memory-loading N+1 in membership check, missing collaborator PATCH/DELETE tests, non-deterministic membership ordering). Three open items deferred (double-query on owner actions, DB call in views, unused E2E import).

- **Test results (actual)**: **118 runs, 275 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips** — **89.18% coverage** (272/305 lines).

- **What's next**: Phase 5 (ActionCable real-time updates), with a recommendation to research channel authentication before building any UI.
