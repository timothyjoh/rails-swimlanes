`STATUS.md` has been written to the project root. Here's a summary of what's in it:

**Phase 1 status at a glance:**
- **Tests**: 30 runs, 71 assertions, **0 failures** — all passing
- **Coverage**: **82.31%** (107/130 lines) — above the 80% floor
- **All MUST-FIX items resolved**: SimpleCov parallelization fixed, DB `null: false` constraint added
- **5 minor fixes addressed** from the review (fixture ordering, negative assertions, E2E URL assertion)
- **3 items deferred to Phase 2**: implicit `require_authentication`, untested `show` action, whitespace name validation
