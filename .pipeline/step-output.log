STATUS.md is updated. Here's what was done:

- **Header**: bumped to "Last updated after Phase 2"
- **Current state**: updated to describe the working board canvas with lanes and drag-and-drop cards
- **Phase 2 section added** with:
  - What was built: Swimlane + Card models, full board canvas, CRUD via Turbo Streams, SortableJS drag-and-drop, authorization chain, tech debt paid from Phase 1
  - How to run it: same install steps, updated narrative for the new board canvas UX
  - Review findings: 1 fixed (boards#show auth test in `b3f839a`), 5 open items deferred to Phase 3
  - What's next: carry-over fixes first, then card details
  - Test coverage: **73 runs, 171 assertions, 0 failures** — **86.19%** line coverage (verified by actually running `bin/rails test`)
