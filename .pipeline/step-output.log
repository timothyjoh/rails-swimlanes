`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
Three architectural decisions embedded in this plan are worth understanding:

1. **Collection vs. member route for `reorder`**: Using `PATCH /boards/:board_id/swimlanes/:swimlane_id/cards/reorder` (collection) with `card_id` in the body is cleaner than a member route because cross-lane drags change the logical "owner" — the destination swimlane is the natural URL, not the card's original location.

2. **Turbo Streams for create/delete, Turbo Frames for edit**: These aren't interchangeable. Streams can target *any* DOM element by ID (good for appending to a list), while Frames replace only their own frame (good for inline forms where the boundary is clear). Using the right tool prevents double-navigation bugs.

3. **SortableJS `group: "cards"`**: The `group` option is what enables cross-lane dragging. Without it, each list is isolated. This single option is the difference between within-lane reordering and the full Trello-like behavior.

The plan has been written to `docs/phases/phase-2/PLAN.md`. Here's what it covers:

**8 tasks, each committable independently:**

1. **Technical debt** — explicit `before_action :require_authentication` in `ApplicationController` + Board name strip fix
2. **Data layer** — `swimlanes` and `cards` migrations, models with strip+presence validation, position auto-increment, cascade destroy; full model unit tests
3. **Nested routes + SwimlanesController** — CRUD scoped to `Current.user.boards`; cross-user returns 404; unauthenticated redirects to login
4. **Board canvas view + swimlane partials** — horizontal scrolling flex layout, Turbo Streams for create/delete, Turbo Frame for inline rename
5. **CardsController + card partials** — full CRUD via same authorization chain; Turbo Streams/Frames for all mutations
6. **SortableJS drag-and-drop** — importmap CDN pin, Stimulus controller with `group: "cards"` for cross-lane dragging, `PATCH /reorder` collection endpoint that rebuilds positions atomically
7. **E2E tests** — shared `e2e/helpers/auth.js` module (eliminates duplication), board canvas spec with drag persistence verified via `page.reload()`
8. **Documentation** — AGENTS.md and README.md updates

**All open questions from RESEARCH.md resolved:**
- CSP is fully commented out → CDN pin is safe
- Turbo Streams for create/delete, Turbo Frames for edit
- Position PATCH returns `head :ok`
- E2E uses shared `helpers/auth.js` with `beforeEach`
- Board show gets its own `overflow-x-auto` wrapper (not constrained by layout's `max-w-4xl`)
- Board name strip added as technical debt Task 1
