STATUS.md is updated. Here's a summary of what was written:

**Phase 3 section covers:**

- **What was built**: Card detail modal via Turbo Frame, description + due date + label fields, `Label`/`CardLabel` models, DB-level card ordering fix, N+1 eager-loading fix, real Playwright drag test replacing the fetch stub

- **How to run it**: Includes `bin/rails db:seed` as a new step needed for the 5 predefined labels

- **Review findings**: All 3 MUST-FIX items are marked resolved (description/due-date Turbo Stream fix, drag assertion fix, overdue HTML assertion fix); 4 open deferred items noted honestly

- **Test results**: 89 runs, 212 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors — **87.06%** line coverage (actual numbers from running the suite)

- **Known gaps**: Upcoming scope boundary, N+1 regression guard, invalid label IDs, Turbo Stream label chip HTML assertion
